# AID604NN


AID604 Protein Target: Rho kinase 2

"AID604 is a primary screening bioassay for Rho kinase 2 inhibitors from the Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center. The bioassay contains activity information of 59,788 compounds with a ratio of 1 active compound to 281 inactive compounds (1.4%). 57,546 of the compounds have known drug-like properties."

Goal: To construct a cNN/NN that will be able to extract the decisive features of an active compound
